description: How to run the application locally.

Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can run the application with the following commands:

```bash
yarn init:env
```

This will generate a new `.env` file in the root directory and create a symlink to `apps/web/.env`.

Alternatively, you can copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# MacOS/Linux
ln -s apps/web/.env .env

# Windows
mklink apps/web/.env .env
```

Then run the following command to start the local database and run database migrations:

```bash
docker-compose up && yarn db:migrate
```

To run the Next.js application, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev:web
```

This will start the Next.js application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Authentication

The application uses Better Auth by default for authentication.
Better Auth requires an `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable to be set.

When using the CLI to generate the `.env` file, a secret is automatically generated and set.

To generate a secret manually, run the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 33
```

Now update the `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable in the `.env` file with the generated secret.

You can now log in with your email address, the confirmation URL will be printed in the console in case you haven't configured any email provider.
