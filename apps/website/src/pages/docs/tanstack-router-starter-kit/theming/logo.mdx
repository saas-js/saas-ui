The logo is located in `packages/ui/src/logo/logo.tsx`.

This file contains the full `Logo` including text and logomark.
And also includes a `LogoIcon` component for the logomark.

Both components render a `svg` wrapped with a Chakra UI `Box`.

To change the logo, you can either modify the existing components or create your own.

It's recommended to use `svg` images for the logo, so it can scale properly on any device and also be styled easily with Chakra UI props.
Make sure to set `fill` or `stroke` to `currentColor` so the logo picks up the color from the `color` prop and can support both light and dark themes.

```tsx
import { Box, type BoxProps } from '@chakra-ui/react'

export function Logo(props: BoxProps) {
  return (
    <Box as="svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100" {...props}>
      <path d="M 0 0 L 100 0 L 100 100 L 0 100 Z" fill="currentColor" />
    </Box>
  )
}
```

## Favicons

Favicons are located in `public/favicons` and can be generated using services like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).

Icons can be configured in `apps/web/index.html` in the `<head>` section.

```tsx
<link rel="icon" href="/favicons/favicon.ico" />
```

## Usage

To use the logo in your application, you can import the `Logo` component from the `@acme/ui/logo`.

```tsx
import { Logo, LogoIcon } from '@acme/ui/logo'
```

Since the component renders a `Box` component, you can pass any valid `Box` props to the component.

```tsx
<Logo color="red" width="100px" />
```
