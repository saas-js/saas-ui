In case you have redeemed your license key and accepted the Github invite, you should now have access to the Saas UI Pro Git repository.

## Clone the repository

To clone the repository on your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch=main git@github.com:saas-js/vite-tanstack-router-starter-kit.git my-project
```

This will clone the repository into the `my-project` folder, without the commit history.

## Setup Git

Now that you have cloned the repository, you can setup your Git configuration.

Rename the `vite-tanstack-router-starter-kit` repository to `upstream`.

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
```

To add your own repository as the `origin`, use the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git
```

You can pull the latest changes from the `upstream` repository using the following command:

```bash
git pull upstream main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

As your codebase diverges from `vite-tanstack-router-starter-kit` you will run into merge conflicts eventually,
so at some point it might be easier to manually copy over any changes that you want to implement.

## Login to the private package registry

The Saas UI Pro packages are hosted on a private package registry (https://npm.saas-ui.dev).

After cloning the repository, log in to the private NPM registry with your license key.

- The `username` is the Github username you used to activate the license.
- The `password` is your license key that you received from Lemonsqueezy or Gumroad.

```bash
yarn npm login --scope saas-ui-pro --always-auth
```

## Install dependencies

This project uses `yarn 4` to manage dependencies, you can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

Yarn is shipped with the repository, so you don't need to install it globally.
If you run into installation issues, you can try to install the latest version of Yarn using the following command:

```bash
yarn set version latest
```

In case this doesn't work, enable corepack and run `yarn` again.

```bash
corepack enable
```
