It's important to keep your dependencies up to date. This helps to ensure that your
application is secure and that you are using the latest features and best practices.

## Manual updates

The best way to manually update dependencies is to use the `yarn upgrade-interactive` command. This will
show you a list of dependencies that can be updated.

```bash
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

This allows you to select which dependencies you want to update.

Be aware that not only major version changes can have breaking changes.
Always make sure to test your application after updating dependencies.

## Automated updates

You can use Github's Dependabot to automatically create pull requests to update your dependencies.

More information can found on the [Dependabot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide).

It's also recommended to use Dependabot to enable alerts for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
