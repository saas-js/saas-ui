description: How to use PNPM instead of Yarn.
---

If you prefer to use `pnpm` instead of `yarn`, you need to set up the `pnpm` workspace.

Create `.pnpm-workspace.yaml` in the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

The recommended way to install PNPM is using `corepack`, you can enable `corepack` using the following command:

```bash
corepack enable
```

Install PNPM:

```bash
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

Then run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Make sure you also update the `scripts` in `package.json` to use `pnpm` instead of `yarn`.
