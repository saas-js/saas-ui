description: Principles that keep your code and UX consistent
---

Saas UI comes with an extensive set of design principes that aim to limit technical
dept in the long run and keep UX consistent throughout your projects life-cyle.
These principles are based on industry standards, but opiniated, they serve as
a starting point for your project.

## Developing components

All basic Chakra UI principles apply when developing components. In case you are not familiar with these principles, here

- **Style Props:** All component styles can be overridden or extended via style
  props to reduce the use of `css` prop or `styled()`. Compose new components
  from `Box`.

- **Simplicity:** Strive to keep the component API fairly simple and show real
  world scenarios of using the component.

- **Composition:** Break down components into smaller parts with minimal props
  to keep complexity low, and compose them together. This will ensure that the
  styles and functionality are flexible and extensible.

- **Accessibility:** When creating a component, keep accessibility top of mind.
  This includes keyboard navigation, focus management, color contrast, voice
  over, and the correct `aria-*` attributes.

- **Dark Mode:** Make components dark mode compatible. Use `useColorMode` hook
  to handle styling. [Learn more about dark mode](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/color-mode).

- **Naming Props:** We all know naming is the hardest thing in this industry.
  Generally, ensure a prop name is indicative of what it does. Boolean props
  should be named using auxiliary verbs such as `does`, `has`, `is` and
  `should`. For example, `Button` uses `isDisabled`, `isLoading`, etc.
