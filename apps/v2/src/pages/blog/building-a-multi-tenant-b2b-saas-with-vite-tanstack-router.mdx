## Introduction

React Server Components (RSC) are the new craze, but what if I told you SPA's (Single-page-app) are here to stay, especially for B2B applications.

This article is the first in a series where we'll build a multi-tenant B2B SaaS. We'll go over the basics of setting up Vite with Tanstack Router and a basic UI with authentication and building an API with Supabase.

Vite is a blazing fast build tool, built on modern standards like ESM and is highly extensible.
Tanstack Router is a powerful new router for React with support for file based routing, is fully type-safe and has a great developer experience.
We'll use Chakra UI with the Saas UI design system for styling.

This stack will be fully type-safe from backend, to routing, and styling. There's no magic, easy to reason about and just a pleasure to work with.

Add the end of this article you will have a basic multi-tenant UI boilerplate to build upon.
You can get the full source code of [this project on Github](https://github.com/saas-js/vite-react-router-spa).

## Setting up Vite

First things first, let's set up Vite. We'll start by creating a new project with Vite.

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-saas -- --template react-ts
```

We'll also install the dependencies for Tanstack Router.

```bash
cd my-saas
npm i @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/router-devtools @tanstack/router-vite-plugin
```

## Configure the Vite plugin

Edit the `vite.config.ts` file and add the following configuration for the router plugin.
The router plugin will handle generating the route tree and types for us.

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { TanStackRouterVite } from '@tanstack/router-vite-plugin'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), TanStackRouterVite()],
})
```

## Setting up the router

Now that we have the router plugin set up, we can start creating our routes. Create a new file called `__root.tsx` in the `src/routes` folder.

```typescript
import { createRootRoute, Link, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <div>
        <Link to="/">
          Home
        </Link>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

Create the index route in `routes/index.tsx`.

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  component: Index,
})

function Index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Welcome Home!</h3>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The Router plugin will generate the route tree for us based on the file structure. The `__root.tsx` file is the root of our route tree and will be used to render the main layout of our application.

We can now initialize the router and setup the context provider. Create a new file called `provider.tsx` in the `src/context` folder.

```typescript
import { RouterProvider, createRouter, Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'

import { routeTree } from '../routeTree.gen'

// Set up a Router instance
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
})

// Register things for typesafety
declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router
  }
}

export const Provider = () => {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  )
}
```

Add the provider to the `main.tsx` file.

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { Provider } from './context/provider'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

Great, we now have a basic setup for the router. Run the dev server with `npm run dev` and open the browser to see the basic layout with the home link and welcome message.

## Styling

To make our application look great, we'll use Chakra UI with the Saas UI design system. First, we'll install the dependencies.

```bash
npm i @saas-ui/react @chakra-ui/react @chakra-ui/next-js @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

Then we need to add the `SaasProvider` to the `context/provider.tsx` file.

```typescript
import { forwardRef } from "react";
import { SaasProvider } from "@saas-ui/react";
import {
  Link,
  LinkProps,
  RouterProvider,
  createRouter,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";

import { routeTree } from "../routeTree.gen";

// Set up a Router instance
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
});

// Register things for typesafety
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}

// This makes sure Saas UI components use our router
const LinkComponent = forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, Pick<LinkProps, "href">>(
  (props, ref) => {
    const { href, ...rest } = props;
    return <Link ref={ref} to={href} {...rest} />;
  }
);

export const Provider = () => {
  return (
    <SaasProvider linkComponent={LinkComponent}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </SaasProvider>
  );
};
```

Now we can start using the Chakra UI components in our application. Let's update the `routes/index.tsx` file to use the Saas UI components.

```tsx
import { Box, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  component: Index,
})

function Index() {
  return (
    <Box p="8">
      <Heading as="h1" mb="4">
        Welcome Home!
      </Heading>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

The app should look much better already :)

## Cleanup

We no longer need the `App.tsx`, `App.css` and `index.css` files that came with Vite, so we can remove them.

```bash
rm src/App.tsx src/App.css src/index.css
```

## Setup React Query

Now that we have the basic layout and styling set up, we can add React Query for data fetching and mutations.

Tanstack router supports loaders, which are functions that can be used to fetch data before rendering the component. Loaders work great with Tanstack Query, which is a powerful data fetching library for React.
Let's set up Tanstack Query and create a simple loader to fetch some data.

```bash
npm i @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

After installing the dependencies, we need to add the `QueryClientProvider` to the `context/provider.tsx` file.

```tsx
import { forwardRef } from 'react'
import { LinkProps, SaasProvider } from '@saas-ui/react'
import { RouterProvider, createRouter, Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

import { routeTree } from '../routeTree.gen'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

// Set up a Router instance
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    queryClient,
  },
  defaultPreload: 'intent',
  // Since we're using React Query, we don't want loader calls to ever be stale
  // This will ensure that the loader is always called when the route is preloaded or visited
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 0,
})

// Register things for typesafety
declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router
  }
}

// This makes sure Saas UI components use our router
const LinkComponent = forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, Pick<LinkProps, 'href'>>(
  (props, ref) => {
    const { href, ...rest } = props
    return <Link ref={ref} to={href} {...rest} />
  }
)

export const Provider = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <SaasProvider linkComponent={LinkComponent}>
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
      </SaasProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

What's notable here is we're setting up a `QueryClient` and providing it to the `QueryClientProvider`. We're also passing the `queryClient` to the router context, so we can use it in our loaders.

Setting the `defaultPreload` to `intent` will ensure that data is preloaded when the user hovers or clicks a `Link`.

We also set `defaultPreloadStaleTime` to 0, which will ensure that the loader is always called when the route is preloaded or visited. This is because React Query will handle the caching and we don't want the loader calls to ever be stale.

### Router context

To make sure the query client type is available in the router context, we need to add the type to the router.

Edit `src/router/__root.tsx` and change `createRootRoute` to `createRootRouteWithContext`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import {
  createRootRouteWithContext,
  Link,
  Outlet,
} from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools'

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<{
  queryClient: QueryClient
}>()({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <div>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

### Fetching data

Now we can create a simple loader to fetch some data. Create a new file called `routes/profile.tsx` in the `src/routes` folder.
We don't have an actual API to fetch data from, so we'll just return some dummy data for now.

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { useQuery, queryOptions } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { Box, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const profileQueryOptions = queryOptions({
  queryKey: ['profile'],
  queryFn: () => {
    return {
      id: '1',
      name: 'John Doe',
    }
  },
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/profile')({
  loader: ({ context: { queryClient } }) =>
    queryClient.ensureQueryData(profileQueryOptions),
  component: Data,
})

function Data() {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(profileQueryOptions)

  return (
    <Box p="8">
      <Heading as="h1" mb="4">
        Profile
      </Heading>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

Open the browser and navigate to the `/profile` route. You should see the dummy data displayed on the page.

Go ahead and delete this file again, we will create a proper API to fetch data from in the next article.

## Adding layouts

Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's add some more advanced features. We'll start by adding layouts to our application.

We'll be creating a `SidebarLayout` for the main layout of our application. This will also need a couple of components.
To make our lives a bit easier and to keep our codebase clean, let's first create an import alias, so we don't need to use relative imports.

### Import alias

Edit `package.json` and add the following to the `imports` field. This will use [Node.js subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports) feature, which is now also natively supported by Typescript.
The benefit of this is that's it's a native feature and doesn't need any bundler configuration or additional tooling.

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
  },
  "imports": {
    "#*": ["./src/*", "./src/*.ts", "./src/*.tsx"]
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Sidebar component

Create a new file called `sidebar.tsx` in the `src/components` folder.

```tsx
import { NavGroup, NavItem, Sidebar, SidebarSection } from '@saas-ui/react'
import { getRouteApi } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const route = getRouteApi('/_app/$workspace/')

export const AppSidebar = () => {
  const params = route.useParams()

  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarSection>
        <NavGroup>
          <NavItem href={`/${params.workspace}`}>Home</NavItem>
        </NavGroup>
      </SidebarSection>
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```

The `getRouteApi` util is used to get the route API for the workspace route. This will allow us to get the workspace from the route params in a type-safe way.

### Sidebar layout

Create a new file called `sidebar-layout.tsx` in the `src/layouts` folder.

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@saas-ui/react'

import { AppSidebar } from '#components/sidebar'

export const SidebarLayout: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren> = (props) => {
  return (
    <AppShell height="$100vh" sidebar={<AppSidebar />}>
      {props.children}
    </AppShell>
  )
}
```

### Layout route

Layout routes are a way to wrap a route with a layout. This is useful for creating a consistent layout for a group of routes.

Create a new file called `_app.tsx` in the `src/routes` folder.

```tsx
import { Outlet, createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

import { SidebarLayout } from '#layouts/sidebar-layout'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/_app')({
  component: AppLayout,
})

function AppLayout() {
  return (
    <SidebarLayout>
      <Outlet />
    </SidebarLayout>
  )
}
```

All routes that are children of the `_app/*` route will now be wrapped in the `AppLayout`.
Routes prefixed with `_` are considered [pathless](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/route-trees#pathless-routes), and will not be part of the final route path.

This will allow us to create different root layouts for the app, authentication screens and marketing pages.

Let's clean up the root layout that we created initially. Edit `src/routes/__root.tsx` and remove the `Link` and html elements.

```tsx
import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { createRootRouteWithContext, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools'

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<{
  queryClient: QueryClient
}>()({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

### Workspace route

Since we're building a multi-tenant SaaS application we'll need a way to handle different workspaces.
We can do that using a dynamic route segments, or path parameters. Segments are prefixed with a `$`.

Create a new folder `$workspace` in `/src/routes/_app` and create a new file called `index.tsx` in that folder.

```tsx
import { Center } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { EmptyState } from '@saas-ui/react'
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/_app/$workspace/')({
  component: Home,
})

function Home() {
  return (
    <Center height="$100vh">
      <EmptyState
        variant="centered"
        title="Nothing here yet"
        description="Add routes and pages to get started"
      />
    </Center>
  )
}
```

Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/test`. You should see the sidebar layout with an empty state displayed on the page.

![Workspace route](/img/blog/vite-spa/app.png)

Amazing work so far! When you go to `http://localhost:5173`, you'll notice we don't have navigation anymore, and there's no way to navigate to the workspace route.
In the next steps we'll add an onboarding screen that will allow users to create a workspace and navigate to it.

## Onboarding

We'll create an onboarding screen that will allow users to create a workspace and navigate to it.
Note that we haven't added authentication yet, don't worry about that for now, we'll cover that in the next article.

For the onboarding screens we want to use a different layouts, without the sidebar.

Create a new file called `fullscreen-layout.tsx` in the `src/layouts` folder.
This layout can be used for features like onboarding, that allow users to focus on a single task.

```tsx
import { AppShell } from '@saas-ui/react'

export const FullscreenLayout: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren> = (props) => {
  return <AppShell height="$100vh">{props.children}</AppShell>
}
```

Create the `_onboarding.tsx` layout route in the `src/routes` folder.

```tsx
import { Outlet, createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

import { FullscreenLayout } from '#layouts/fullscreen-layout'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/_onboarding')({
  component: OnboardingLayout,
})

function OnboardingLayout() {
  return (
    <FullscreenLayout>
      <Outlet />
    </FullscreenLayout>
  )
}
```

And create the page route in `src/routes/_onboarding/getting-started.tsx`.

```tsx
import { Center, Container, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { Field, Form, FormLayout, SubmitButton } from '@saas-ui/react'
import { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { createFileRoute, useNavigate } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { FormEvent } from 'react'

const slugify = (value: string) => {
  return value
    .trim()
    .toLocaleLowerCase()
    .replace(/[^\w\s-]/g, '')
    .replace(/[\s_-]+/g, '-')
    .replace(/^-+|-+$/g, '')
}

export const Route = createFileRoute('/_onboarding/getting-started')({
  component: GettingStarted,
})

interface OnboardingData {
  organization: string
  workspace: string
}

function GettingStarted() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  const submit = useMutation<unknown, Error, OnboardingData>({
    mutationFn: async (values) => {
      localStorage.setItem('workspace', values.workspace)
    },
    onSuccess: (data, variables) => {
      navigate({
        to: '/$workspace',
        params: { workspace: variables.workspace },
      })
    },
  })

  return (
    <Center height="$100vh">
      <Container maxW="container.sm">
        <Heading as="h2" size="lg" mb="4">
          Getting started
        </Heading>
        <Form
          onSubmit={(data) => submit.mutateAsync(data)}
          defaultValues={{
            organization: '',
            workspace: '',
          }}
        >
          {({ setValue }) => (
            <FormLayout>
              <Field
                label="Organization name"
                name="organization"
                onChange={(e: FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
                  const value = e.currentTarget.value
                  setValue('organization', value)
                  setValue('workspace', slugify(value))
                }}
              />
              <Field label="Workspace" name="workspace" />
              <SubmitButton>Continue</SubmitButton>
            </FormLayout>
          )}
        </Form>
      </Container>
    </Center>
  )
}
```

Ok, so what's going on here? We're using the `useMutation` hook from Tanstack Query to handle the form submission. When the form is submitted, we'll save the workspace to `localStorage` and navigate to the workspace route.

We're using Saas UI `Form` component that allows us to quickly created type-safe forms. It also has support for `Zod`, `Yup` and `JsonSchema`.

Whenever the `organization` value changes we automatically update the `workspace` value using the `slugify` function to pre-fill the `workspace` field.

The screen should look like this:

![Getting started](/img/blog/vite-spa/getting-started.png)

Try it out yourself at `http://localhost:5173/getting-started`.

## Redirecting the user

When the user navigates to the root of the application, we want to redirect them to the workspace route if they have a workspace in `localStorage`, otherwise we want to redirect them to the onboarding screen.

Edit `src/routes/index.tsx` and add the following code.

```tsx
import { Box, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  component: Index,
  beforeLoad: async () => {
    // We will add authentication here later
    const user = {
      id: '123',
      email: 'john.doe@acme.com',
    }

    if (!user) {
      return
    }

    const workspace = localStorage.getItem('workspace')

    const path = workspace ? `/${workspace}` : '/getting-started'

    throw redirect({
      to: path,
    })
  },
})

function Index() {
  return (
    <Box p="8">
      <Heading as="h1" mb="4">
        Welcome Home!
      </Heading>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

We're using the `beforeLoad` hook to check if the user has a workspace in `localStorage`. If they do, we'll redirect them to the workspace route, otherwise we'll redirect them to the onboarding screen.
If the user is not authenticated, we'll just return and show the home screen.

Now navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and you should be redirected.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've set up a basic multi-tenant B2B SaaS application boilerplate using Vite, Tanstack Router, Chakra UI and Saas UI.
We've also added React Query for data fetching and mutations, and created a simple onboarding screen.

In the next article, we'll add authentication (Supabase Auth), and a proper API to fetch data from.
I'm not sure yet what we're going to use for the API, we might use Supabase directly or use Hono, what do you think?
