<Info>
  This authentication provider is no longer supported in the latest version of
  the starter kit and we recommend using the [Better
  auth](/docs/nextjs-starter-kit/authentication/better-auth) provider instead.
</Info>

If you do want to use Auth.js, you can follow their [Getting Started Guide](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=Next.js).
