We're excited to announce a significant enhancement to our Next.js starter kit with the integration of Better Auth,
a robust authentication solution designed specifically for modern web applications.
This integration brings new authentication capabilities, like Passkeys, while maintaining the simplicity and developer experience you've come to expect from our starter kit.

## What is Better Auth?

Better Auth is a comprehensive authentication solution that provides secure, scalable, and customizable authentication services. It handles everything from basic email/password authentication to more complex scenarios like social logins, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and enterprise SSO, all while maintaining top-tier security standards.

## Key features of the integration

The integration provides a smooth authentication experience right out of the box:

- New pre-built authentication pages, including password reset and email verification.
- Social login support for popular providers (Google, GitHub, etc.).
- Email/password authentication.
- Improved UX by showing the last used authentication method to the user.

## Future improvements

- Passkeys
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Enterprise SSO
- Audit logs

## Conclusion

The integration of Better Auth into the Saas UI Next.js starter kit provides a robust, secure, and developer-friendly authentication solution.
It allows you to focus on building your application's unique features while having confidence in your authentication system.

For more detailed information, check out our documentation and the Better Auth API reference.
