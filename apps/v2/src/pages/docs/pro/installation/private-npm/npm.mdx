description: Install Saas UI Pro components from the private NPM registry using NPM.
---

In the next steps we'll show you how to install `@saas-ui-pro/react` in new or existing projects.
You'll need a valid license to install Pro, you can order one [here](/pricing).

<Info>
  Before continuing [follow these steps](/docs/core/quickstarts) to set up
  `@saas-ui/react` and `@chakra-ui/react` in your project, if you haven't done
  so already.
</Info>

## Configuration

All pro packages can be installed from our private NPM registry at https://npm.saas-ui.dev.
After [redeeming](/redeem) your license, an account will be automatically created.

Your NPM account is a combination of the Github username (in lower case) you used to redeem your license and the license code (`username:license-key`). This key can be shared across your team members.

<NpmAuthToken />

<Info>
  Configuration is slightly different for each package manager, so it's
  important to follow the steps for the package manager you are using in your
  project.
</Info>

### NPM

In your project root folder you can run this and enter your Github username as user and license key as password.

```bash
npm login --registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev/ --scope=@saas-ui-pro
```

Now run `npm i @saas-ui-pro/react` to install the Pro components.

#### Manual & CI configuration.

The following steps are required to deploy your project or run it on CI.

<Info>
  NPM expects auth to be base64 encoded, so make sure `SAAS_UI_TOKEN` is
  encoded.
</Info>

```bash
echo -n 'GithubUsername:licenseKey' | base64
```

Add your auth token to shell profile `~/.bash_profile` and add it to environment variables of your deployment or CI.

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="base64 encoded token"
```

If you configure this on your local machine, make sure the restart your terminal
or run `source ~/.bash_profile`, to make sure the token is loaded.

<Info>
  If you're having troubles generating a working base64 encoded string, try
  [this website](https://www.base64encode.org/).
</Info>

Then edit `.npmrc` in the root of your project and add the following lines.

```
@saas-ui-pro:registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:_auth="${SAAS_UI_TOKEN}"
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:always-auth=true
```

Now run `npm i @saas-ui-pro/react` to check if the configuration was succesful.
