For demo and testing purposes, you can seed the database with some test data
using the following command:

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

After the script is finished it will print the created users credentials. You
can use these credentials to log in to the application.

## Reset database

To reset the database and seed it with new data, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm db:seed --reset
```

This will drop all tables and re-run all migrations.

## Customize user account

You can customize the user account creation with the following parameters:

```bash
pnpm db:seed --email=demo@example.com --password=demo12345
```
