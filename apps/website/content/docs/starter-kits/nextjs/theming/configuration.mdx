## Configure your theme

You can find you base theme in `packages/theme`, this is where you can customize your theme.

Read more about theme customization on the [Chakra UI website](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme).

```tsx
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import {
  theme as baseTheme,
  /* withThemeColors */
} from '@saas-ui-pro/react'

// import { theme as glassTheme } from '@saas-ui-pro/theme-glass'
import { components } from './components'
import semanticTokens from './foundations/semantic-tokens'

// import colorScheme from './color-schemes/galaxy'
// import colorScheme from './color-schemes/earth'

export const theme = extendTheme(
  {
    semanticTokens,
    components,
  },
  /**
   * Uncomment this to use any of the built-in color schemes.
   */
  // withThemeColors(colorScheme),
  // glassTheme,
  baseTheme
)
```

The theme extends the Saas UI Pro default theme and includes a set of [semantic tokens](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/semantic-tokens) and custom component styles.

## Glass theme

To use the glass theme, replace the `baseTheme` with `glassTheme`.

```tsx
export const theme = extendTheme(
  {
    semanticTokens,
    components,
  },
  glassTheme
)
```

## Color schemes

The project ships with a number of color schemes that you can use out of the box.
Color schemes are different from themes, they only change the color palette of the theme.

To use a color scheme, import it and pass it to the `withThemeColors` function.

```tsx
import { withColorScheme, theme as baseTheme } from '@saas-ui-pro/react'
import colorScheme from './color-schemes/galaxy'

export const theme = extendTheme(
  {
    semanticTokens,
    components,
  },
  withColorScheme(colorScheme),
  baseTheme
)
```
