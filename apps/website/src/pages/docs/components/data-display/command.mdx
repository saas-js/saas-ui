title: Command
description: "A command is used to show which key or combination of keys
performs a given action."
---

The `Command` component wraps individual keys in a `<Kbd />` component.

<ComponentLinks pro={{ gumroad: true }} />

## Import

```js
import { Command } from '@saas-ui/pro'
```

```jsx
<Command>shift H</Command>
```

## Guideline

All shortcuts should do their best to match what appears on the user’s keyboard.
Use [useHotkeys](/navigation/hotkeys) to manage and register your hotkey actions.

- All single letters A-Z are uppercase.
- For non-letter keys such as enter, esc and shift, stick to lowercase.
- Use symbols (⌥ ⇧ ⌃ ⌘) as opposed to spelling things out.

## Modifier

The only punctuation you should need is the **+** to indicate that a combination
of keys will activate the shortcut, used on Windows and Unix machines.

```jsx
<Command>shift+X</Command>
```

For a sequence of keys where one must follow the other, write "then" in between.
Stick to lowercase to match the non-letter keys.

```jsx
<Command>G then D</Command>
```

If two different keys can execute the same action or the shortcut itself may
look different on the user’s keyboard, write "or" in between.

```jsx
<Command>alt or option</Command>
```

## Use in tooltips

```jsx
<Tooltip
  label={
    <>
      Go to dashboard <Command>G then D</Command>
    </>
  }
>
  <Button>Dashboard</Button>
</Tooltip>
```
