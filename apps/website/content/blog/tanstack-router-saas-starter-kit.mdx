## Introducing Tanstack Router SaaS Starter Kit

TanStack Router is a new fully typesafe router for React applications. It's a great choice for building B2B SaaS applications with a focus on developer experience and performance.

We've been building apps with this stack for a while now with great success, and we're excited to share it with you.

## Why TanStack Router?

TanStack Router is a great choice if you're building B2B applications and you don't want to deal with the complexity of Next.js.
It's a classic SPA setup but with the benefits of a modern router.

- `TypeScript first`: 100% inferred TypeScript support
- `1st class search parameters`: Search param validation and APIs
- `Dev performance`: Blazing fast thanks to Vite.js
- `Filebased or code based routing`: Choose your favorite approach

## SaaS Starter Kit features

The kit includes all features you'd expect from a starter kit and includes all the features from our Next.js SaaS starter kit.

- `Multi-tenancy`: Team and role management
- `Authentication`: Built with Better Auth
- `Database`: Drizzle ORM with Postgres (Supabase, Neon, etc.)
- `Subscription management`: Built with Stripe
- `Cursor rules`: Cursor rules included to make your life easier
