In case you have redeemed your license key and accepted the Github invite, you
should now have access to the Saas UI Pro Git repository.

## Clone the repository

To clone the repository on your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch=v3 git@github.com:saas-js/tanstack-start-starter-kit-pro.git my-project
```

This will clone the repository into the `my-project` folder, without the commit
history.

## Setup Git

Now that you have cloned the repository, you can setup your Git configuration.

Rename the `tanstack-start-starter-kit-pro` repository to `upstream`.

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
```

To add your own repository as the `origin`, use the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git
```

You can pull the latest changes from the `upstream` repository using the
following command:

```bash
git pull upstream v3 --allow-unrelated-histories
```

As your codebase diverges from `tanstack-start-starter-kit-pro` you will run
into merge conflicts eventually, so at some point it might be easier to manually
copy over any changes that you want to implement.

## Install dependencies

This project uses `pnpm` to manage dependencies, you can install all
dependencies using the following command:

<Info>
  If you don't have `pnpm` installed, follow the [pnpm installation
  guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).
</Info>

```bash
pnpm
```
