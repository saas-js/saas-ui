description: How to configure environment variables in the TanStack Router starter kit.
---

The TanStack Router starter kit uses environment variables to configure the application.
This allows you to separate configuration from your codebase and keep sensitive information secure.

## Configuration

<Info>
  We recommend _NEVER_ to check in any .env files in order to prevent leaking
  secrets into your Git repository.
</Info>

Environment variables should always be configured using your CI/CD provider. For example, GitHub Actions, Vercel, etc. Never store secrets in your repository.

Run `yarn turbo gen env` to generate a new .env file.

Alternatively, you can copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

<Info status="warning">
  The `gen` command will create a symlink from `.env` to `apps/web/.env`. This
  will not work on Windows and you create a link or copy the `.env` to
  `apps/web/.env` yourself.
</Info>

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
mklink apps/web/.env .env
```

```bash
# The public URL of the application
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Default plan id for new accounts.
# Plans are configured in `packages/config/billing.config.ts`.
DEFAULT_PLAN_ID=free@1

# Email
# The email address that will be used to send emails from the application.
# This domain must be verified in your email provider.
EMAIL_FROM="hello@saas-ui.dev"

# Resend (default email provider)
# You can find this value in your Resend project settings.
RESEND_API_KEY=

# Database
# Uses a local docker instance by default.
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:admin@localhost:5432/dev

# Better Auth
AUTH_SECRET=

# Stripe (default payment provider)
# You can find these values in your Stripe dashboard, under developer settings.
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

## Using environment variables

All environment variables are defined using a Zod schema in `packages/env/env.ts`.
This allows us to validate the environment variables and give us type-safety / auto-completion in our codebase.

You can import environment variables from `env`, only `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed variables are exposed to the client.

```ts
import { env } from 'env'

console.log(env.DATABASE_URL)
```
