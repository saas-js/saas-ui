### Yarn

<Info>
  This configuration is for **Yarn 3+**, if you are still using Yarn 1.2 it's
  highly recommended to upgrade. <br />
  [Migration guide.](https://yarnpkg.com/migration/guide)
</Info>

Your NPM account is a combination of the Github username (in lower case) you used to redeem your license and the license code (`username:license-key`). This key can be shared across your team members.

<NpmAuthToken />

In the root of your project edit `.yarnrc.yml` and add the following lines.

```yml
npmScopes:
  saas-ui-pro:
    npmRegistryServer: 'https://npm.saas-ui.dev'
npmRegistries:
  //npm.saas-ui.dev:
    npmAuthIdent: '${SAAS_UI_TOKEN:-}'
    npmAlwaysAuth: true
```

To set it up on your dev machine add the SAAS_UI_TOKEN to `~/.bash_profile` or your CI configuration.

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="github-username:license-key"
```

The same configuration can be used for CI and deployments.

Run `yarn add @saas-ui-pro/react` to see if the configuration was succesful.

If you have issues getting this to work, try base64 encoding your auth token. You can create and copy the encoded token above.
