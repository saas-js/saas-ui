The starter kit makes sure your application is in sync with your billing provider by using webhooks.

By default Stripe is used as the billing provider and all required events are handled for you.
In case you want to add custom logic you can add your own event handler.

Edit `apps/web/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` to add your own event handlers.

```ts
import { createStripeWebhookHandler } from '@acme/billing-stripe'

export const POST = createStripeWebhookHandler({
  onEvent: async (event) => {
    console.log('[Stripe] Received event:', event.type)
  },
})
```

The `onEvent` function is called for all events that you've enabled in your Stripe dashboard.

Read more about webhooks in the [Stripe documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).
