The Saas UI starterkit uses a PostgreSQL database managed by Drizzle.

## Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is a powerful and proven open-source SQL database. It's fast, reliable, and has a rich feature set. It's also easy to use and has a large community of users and contributors.
It is very versatile and can be used as queueing system, kv, document store, vector search and a lot more.

You can run it yourself or choose of one of the many great managed services like, Vercel Postgres, Neon or Supabase.

## Why Drizzle?

Drizzle is designed to be simple to use and easy to understand and helps you become better at SQL instead of abstracting it.
Because it's fully typed, it fits in perfectly with tRPC and the general workflow of this starterkit.
