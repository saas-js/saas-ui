For the last two years I've been using a `createPage` helper with Next.js that
allows you to re-use some common features, like fetching data, checking roles or feature flags, etc.
This idea was originally posted by [Rado Stankov](https://blog.rstankov.com/structuring-next-js-application/) and I've been using it ever since.

With the release of the app router in Next.js 13 I've been looking for a way to improve this pattern
and make better use of RSC (React Server Components), but didn't find a setup yet that I was fully happy with.

Earlier this week I came across a tweet from [@matt_stobbs](https://x.com/matt_stobbs/status/1807408408011690178) that showed the new
`defineRoute` function that will be introduced in React Router (and Remix) when it dawned on me that I could use this
to improve my `createPage` helper.

## How it works

Here's an example how the new `createPage` helper is used in the [Saas UI Pro starterkit](https://saas-ui.dev/nextjs-starter-kit).

```tsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
import { z } from 'zod'

import { DashboardPage } from '#features/workspaces/dashboard'
import { createPage } from '#lib/create-page'
import { api } from '#lib/trpc/rsc.js'

const { Page, generateMetaData } = createPage({
  params: z.object({
    workspace: z.string(),
  }),
  searchParams: ['test'],
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    const workspace = await api.workspaces.bySlug({
      slug: params.workspace,
    })

    if (!workspace) {
      notFound()
    }

    return {
      workspace,
    }
  },
  metadata: async ({ data }) => ({
    title: `Dashboard - ${data.workspace.name}`,
  }),
  component: ({ params, searchParams, data }) => (
    <DashboardPage
      params={params}
      searchParams={searchParams}
      workspace={data.workspace}
    />
  ),
})

export { generateMetaData }

export default Page
```

So what's happening here?

The `createPage` function is a factory function that returns a `Page` component and `metadata` or `generateMetaData` that can be exported from an app router `page.tsx`.

We can define `params` and `searchParams` using Zod schemas (or an array with the param names `['workspace']`).
These then become available in the `loader` function that is called server-side to fetch the data for the metadata and page component.

In this example we're fetchin data from a tRPC procedure, but this could be any async function that returns the data needed for the page.
The return value of the loader function is then inferred by the metadata, and component handlers.

The component returned by the `createPage` is a React Server Component that wraps the `DashboardPage` component, which can be a regular client component, or another RSC.

Now we no longer have to import and move around types, params and searchParams are validated, and established a common pattern for fetching initial data for our metadata and page components.

## Extending the helper

You can easily extend this helper with extra functionality, like role access.

```tsx
const { Page, generateMetaData } = createPage({
  roles: ['admin'],
  component: ({ params, searchParams, data }) => (
    <AdminPage params={params} searchParams={searchParams} data={data} />
  ),
})
```

## Source code

You can [find the source code in this gist](https://gist.github.com/Pagebakers/f39f154e5bb6b03c477cb4a1d88ac937), there are still a few details I'm not certain about.

- Use `safeParse` for the params and searchParams?
- Should the `component` be wrapped with `Suspense`?
- Can we hydrate the data returned from the loader function easily to React Query.
- `cache` the loader function?
- Turn this into a library?

Please do leave a comment (below the gist) if you have idea's, suggestions or other feedback.

Thanks for reading :)
