For the past 8 years I've worked for a hand full of startups, including my own. Most failed,
some got series C funding and, together with my former business partner, I managed to bootstrap a [succesful product](https://belco.io) hitting over â‚¬50k+ MRR.
In this post I'll go over all the things I learned about building frontends for these software as a service products.

## 1. Choose the right tools

## 2. Project structure

## 3. Prevent technical debt

## 4. Do a complete rewrite

## 5. Don't reinvent the wheel
