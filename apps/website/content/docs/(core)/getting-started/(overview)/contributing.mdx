  information.

  Discussion, or find existing bugs to work on.

## Architecture

Saas v3.x is built on top of Chakra UI v3.x, and is a composition of two projects in the Chakra ecosystem, Ark UI and
Zag.js.

- [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) - The foundation of Saas UI
- [Ark UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark) - State machine from Zag.js converted to headless UI components
- [Zag.js](https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag) - Component logic modelled as a state machine

### Filing Issues

Before opening an issue, please check the following:

- If the issue is a logic or accessibility bug, then it's most likely a bug in
  Zag.js. Consider opening an issue in the Zag.js repository.

- If it's a styling issue, then you can fix it directly in the Saas UI repo.

Feel free to open any feature requests, we'll review them to see if they're a good fit for Saas UI or if they should be implemented in Chakra UI or Zag.js.
