<Info>
  It is no longer necessary to use our private NPM registry to install Saas UI Pro.

The Saas UI Pro packages are now published to the public NPM registry.

</Info>

All `@saas-ui-pro` packages can be installed from our private NPM registry.
While the source code of these packages is included in the Saas UI Pro repository, you can use the private NPM registry to install them in existing projects.

Setting up a private NPM registry for Saas UI Pro is a simple process. You can use any of the popular package managers like NPM, Yarn, or PNPM to install Saas UI Pro from your private NPM registry.

<Info>
  The instructions are slightly different for each package manager, so we have
  separate guides for each of them.
