This release comes with improved type-safety for forms and the modal manager, improved APIs and composition of components, a long with a lot of bug fixes and improvements.

## Forms

- `Form` now accepts a render prop that gives you access to the internal form state, as well as typed Form components.

```tsx
export default function MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <Form defaultValues={{name: ''}}>
      {({Field}) => (
        <Field type="text" name="name" />
      )}
    </Form>
  )
}
```

- `AutoForm` has been removed, you can use `Form` instead. `Form` will auto render fields based on the schema you pass to it, when no children are provided.

- Importing `Form` from `@saas-ui/forms/yup` or `@saas-ui/forms/zod` gives you a typed `Form` component. No longer needed to use `useForm` or `getResolver`.

- `registerFieldType` has been renamed to `createField` and can be used together with `createForm` to create forms with custom fields.

```tsx
// form.tsx
import { createForm, createField } from '@saas-ui/react'

// zod
// import {createZodForm} from '@saas-ui/forms/zod'

// yup
// import {createYupForm} from '@saas-ui/forms/yup'

const MyCustomField = createField(
  React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
    return <input ref={ref} {...props} />
  })
)

const MyCustomControlledField = createField(
  React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
    return <ReactSelect ref={ref} {...props} />
  }),
  {
    isControlled: true,
  }
)

export const Form = createForm({
  fields: {
    custom: MyCustomField,
    'custom-controlled': MyCustomControlledField,
  },
})
```

## StepForm

`StepForm` has a new improved API, similar to `Form`.

```tsx
import {StepForm} from '@saas-ui/react'

// zod
// import { StepForm } from '@saas-ui/forms/zod'

// yup
// import { StepForm } from '@saas-ui/forms/yup'

export default function MyStepForm = () => {
  return (
    <StepForm
      defaultValues={{
        name: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
      }}
      onSubmit={onSubmit}
    >
      {({ Field, FormStep }) => (
        <FormLayout>
          <FormStep name="profile">
            <FormLayout>
              <Field name="name" label="Name" rules={{ required: true }} />
              <Field name="email" label="Email" rules={{ required: true }} />
              <NextButton />
            </FormLayout>
          </FormStep>
          <FormStep name="password">
            <FormLayout>
              <Field
                name="password"
                label="Password"
                rules={{ required: true, minLength: 4 }}
              />
              <NextButton />
            </FormLayout>
          </FormStep>
        </FormLayout>
      )}
    </StepForm>
  )
}
```

Zod and Yup forms now expect a `steps` property that contains the schemas for each step.

```tsx
export default function MyStepForm = () => {
  return (
    <StepForm
      steps={[{
        name: 'profile',
        schema: z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          email: z.string().email(),
        })
      }, {
        name: 'password',
        schema: z.object({
          password: z.string().min(4),
        })
      }]}
      defaultValues={{
        name: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
      }}
      onSubmit={onSubmit}
    >
      {({ Field, FormStep }) => (
        <FormLayout>
          <FormStep name="profile">
            <FormLayout>
              <Field name="name" label="Name" rules={{ required: true }} />
              <Field name="email" label="Email" rules={{ required: true }} />
              <NextButton />
            </FormLayout>
          </FormStep>
          <FormStep name="password">
            <FormLayout>
              <Field
                name="password"
                label="Password"
                rules={{ required: true, minLength: 4 }}
              />
              <NextButton />
            </FormLayout>
          </FormStep>
        </FormLayout>
      )}
    </StepForm>
  )
}
```

## FormDialog

`FormDialog` now comes with a Yup and Zod variant out of the box.

To use Zod schemas, you can import `FormDialog` from `@saas-ui/forms/zod` (or `@saas-ui/forms/yup` for Yup schemas)

```jsx
import { Button, useDisclosure } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { FormLayout, createFormDialog } from '@saas-ui/react'
import { FiUsers, FiTag, FiArchive } from 'react-icons/fi'
import { FormDialog } from '@saas-ui/forms/zod'
import * as z from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({
  title: z.string().describe('Title'),
  description: z.string().optional().describe('Description'),
})

export default function Page() {
  const disclosure = useDisclosure()

  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    disclosure.onClose()
  }

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => disclosure.onOpen()}>Create new post</Button>

      <FormDialog
        title="New post"
        schema={schema}
        {...disclosure}
        defaultValues={{
          title: '',
          description: '',
        }}
        fields={{
          description: {
            type: 'textarea',
          },
        }}
        onSubmit={onSubmit}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Modals

The modals manager now has a new API that allows you to create modals or change the default modals in a convenient way.

```tsx
import { createModals } from '@saas-ui/react'
import { FormDialog } from '@saas-ui/forms/zod'

const { ModalsProvider, useModals } = createModals({
  modals: {
    modal: MyModal,
    custom: CustomModal,
    form: FormDialog,
  },
})

function App({ children }) {
  return <ModalsProvider>{children}</ModalsProvider>
}

function Page() {
  const modals = useModals()

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() =>
        modals.open({
          title: 'My modal',
          body: 'Custom modal',
          type: 'custom',
        })
      }
    >
      Open custom modal
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## Components

### List

`List` has been renamed to `StructuredList` and has a new improved API that gives you much more flexibility to build all kinds of lists, [see documentation](/docs/components/data-display/structured-list).

```tsx
<StructuredList>
  <StructuredListItem>
    <StructuredListCell>
      <Text fontWeight="bold">Elliot Alderson</Text>
      <Text fontSize="sm" color="muted">
        Hacker
      </Text>
    </StructuredListCell>
    <StructuredListCell>
      <Tag>admin</Tag>
    </StructuredListCell>
  </StructuredListItem>
</StructuredList>
```

### Loader

`Loader` has been renamed to `LoadingOverlay` and has a new improved API.

```tsx
<LoadingOverlay>
  <LoadingSpinner />
</LoadingOverlay>
```

### Sidebar

The `Sidebar` is out of beta.

[See the full changelog](/changelog#06-30-2023).

## Future of Saas UI

There is a lot of good stuff coming in the next 6 months, here's a little sneak peak of what to expect.

### New components

We will be releasing more Pro components in the Open Source library in the next few months to give you more building blocks to build your applications.

### Figma design system

After much request we are also working on a new Figma design system that will be released very soon, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4PmJGFcAjX) to get early access.

### Cross framework design system

There has been a big move away from CSS-in-JS in the last 6 months,
in big part due to the introduction of the Next.js app router and RSC (React Server Components).
This came with a lot of misconceptions and confusion about client side components (`use server` vs `use client`) being bad and server components are the way forward.
The fact is you cannot build modern web applications without client side components, we believe there is a big role for SPAs applications.
Especially for the types of apps Saas UI is designed for, B2B applications, dashboards and internal tools that are not public facing and need to be highly interactive.
JSX with CSS-in-JS like APIs is still the best way to build these types of applications.

Today you can already use Chakra UI and Saas UI with the Next.js app directory to build SPA style applications.
The app directory gives you a much better router with nested layouts and a much better developer experience for data fetching with server components.
While the app directory has been released as stable, it still comes with a lot of performance issues in development and we still recommend the pages router for now.

We will continue to work on the Chakra UI version of Saas UI, but have also started exploring to bring the Saas UI design system to other platforms.
With the releases of Mitosis, Zag.js, Ark and PandaCSS opening the door for maintainable cross framework UI libraries, we are very excited about the future of Saas UI.
