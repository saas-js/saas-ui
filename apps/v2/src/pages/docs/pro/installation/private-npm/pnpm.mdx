description: Install Saas UI Pro components from the private NPM registry using PNPM.
---

### PNPM

Your NPM account is a combination of the Github username (in lower case) you used to redeem your license and the license code (`username:license-key`). This key can be shared across your team members.

<NpmAuthToken />

In your project root folder you can run this and enter your Github username as user and license key as password.

```bash
pnpm login --registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev/ --scope=@saas-ui-pro
```

Now run `npm i @saas-ui-pro/react` to install the Pro components.

#### Manual & CI configuration.

The following steps are required to deploy your project or run it on CI.

<Info>
  PNPM expects auth to be base64 encoded, so make sure `SAAS_UI_TOKEN` is
  encoded.
</Info>

```bash
echo -n 'username:license-key' | base64
```

Add your auth token to shell profile `~/.bash_profile` and add it to environment variables of your deployment or CI.

```bash
export SAAS_UI_TOKEN="base64 encoded token"
```

If you configure this on your local machine, make sure the restart your terminal
or run `source ~/.bash_profile`, to make sure the token is loaded.

Then edit `.npmrc` in the root of your project and add the following lines.

```
@saas-ui-pro:registry=https://npm.saas-ui.dev
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:_auth="${SAAS_UI_TOKEN}"
//npm.saas-ui.dev/:always-auth=true
```

Now run `pnpm i @saas-ui-pro/react` to check if the configuration was succesful.
