We're excited to announce Playwright integration for both TanStack Start and
Next.js starter kits! This release brings comprehensive end-to-end testing
capabilities and groundbreaking AI-powered visual testing through Playwright
MCP.

## What's new?

### Playwright E2E Testing Setup

Both TanStack Start and Next.js starter kits now come with a fully configured
Playwright testing setup out of the box. This includes:

- **Pre-configured test environment** - Ready-to-use Playwright config with
  sensible defaults
- **Example test suites** - Sample tests to get you started with best practices
- **CI/CD integration** - GitHub Actions workflow for running tests on every
  commit
- **Multiple browser support** - Test across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Screenshots** - Automatic capture on test failures for debugging
- **Parallel test execution** - Fast test runs with built-in parallelization

Getting started is as simple as running `npm run test:e2e` to launch your test
suite. The setup handles authentication flows, page navigation, form
interactions, and visual regression testing right out of the gate.

### Playwright MCP - Giving AI Eyes

Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a game-changer for AI-assisted
development. It literally gives AI assistants like Claude the ability to "see"
and interact with your web application in real-time.

**How it works:**

Playwright MCP provides AI assistants with the ability to:

- **Launch and control browsers** - Spin up browser instances and navigate your
  application
- **Take screenshots** - Capture visual state of any page or component
- **Interact with elements** - Click buttons, fill forms, and perform user
  actions
- **Analyze accessibility** - Check ARIA labels, roles, and semantic HTML
- **Validate responsive design** - Test across different viewport sizes
- **Read the DOM** - Understand page structure and content

**Why this matters for UI development:**

Traditional AI assistance is limited to code - it can read your JSX/TSX but
can't see what actually renders. With Playwright MCP, AI can:

1. **Verify implementations visually** - See if your code produces the intended
   UI
2. **Catch visual bugs** - Spot layout issues, styling problems, and responsive
   breakpoints
3. **Improve accessibility** - Analyze the rendered output for accessibility
   issues
4. **Write better tests** - Generate accurate selectors based on what it
   actually sees
5. **Debug faster** - Take screenshots at failure points to understand what went
   wrong
6. **Validate cross-browser compatibility** - Test across different browsers and
   devices

This dramatically improves the quality and accuracy of UI-related tasks. Instead
of guessing whether a component looks right, AI can now verify it visually, just
like a human QA engineer would.

### Getting Started

To use Playwright MCP with Claude Code, install the Playwright MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

Now your AI assistant can visually verify every UI change it makes, ensuring
pixel-perfect implementations and catching issues before they reach production.
