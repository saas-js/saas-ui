              The single license can be used for unlimited self hosted SaaS
              products or internal tools and maximum one client project. You can
              buy as many licenses as you need. <br /> The unlimited license
              does not have any restrictions.

        <FaqItem
          question="Can I use Saas UI Pro for Open Source projects?"

          question="Does Saas UI include Figma, Sketch or other design files?"

        <FaqItem
          question="Does Saas UI have a Javascript version?"

        <FaqItem
          question="What does 'lifetime access' mean?"
          answer="The Saas UI Pro license is perpetual, you will have access to all assets of the Saas UI Pro library forever."
        />
        <FaqItem
          question="What does '1 year of updates' include?"
          answer={
            <>
              We&apos;ll add new components and improvements to the library as
              we get new ideas and feedback, you will receive these updates
              during the first year. After that you can renew your license if
              you want to keep receiving updates.
              <br />
              <br />
              We might release different stacks, for example for Vue and
              backends, these will be sold seperately.

        <FaqItem
          question="I'm not satisfied, can I get my money back?"
          answer="Yeah, no hard feelings. Saas UI is opinionated and might not suit your style, let us know within 14 days of your purchase and we'll refund your money."
